## Case Study - Cyclistic Bike Share
This project used actual data from Chicago's Divvy bicycle sharing service to simulate data for Cyclistic, a fictional bike share company. Using 12 months of historical data, I identified trends in ridership between the company's membership groups (annual members and casual riders) to inform decisions about a new marketing campaign to maximize annual memberships.
