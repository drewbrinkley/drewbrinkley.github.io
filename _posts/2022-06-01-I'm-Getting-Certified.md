# I'm Getting Certified
Post date:  June 1, 2022

## An Intro to Certifications
A quick Google search for "IT Certifications" delivered first-page hits like _29 Most Valuable IT Certifications_, _21 IT Certifications in Demand for 2022_, and _15 Top-Paying IT Certifications for 2021_.  Basically, there's no shortage of options to get certified in the technology field.  Certifications in IT, as with other fields, are a way that you can verify you possess a particular skill or set of skills.  They are typically specialized in a particular subject area, and they may even be vendor-specific.  In this post, I will examine some of the benefits and drawbacks of seeking certification and provide an account of my beginning to stack up certifications.

## Google IT Support
IT Support is one of the Google Career Certificate programs designed to provide online training and certification in the technology field.  The program is hosted on Coursera and features lectures, assessments, and online discussion to facilitate learning.  There are also a number of lessons that allow you to spin up virtual machines to get hands-on practice and application of concepts like managing domain users and group policy with Active Directory, using common tools to configure Windows via the graphical user interface, and executing Windows and Linux commands via the command line.  The certificate covered technical support fundamentals, networking, operating systems, system administration, troubleshooting, security, and mobile devices.

## CompTIA A+
The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is a vendor-neutral, independent organization that provides education, training, and certification in the field of technology.  They offer four "core" certifications, one of which is called CompTIA A+.  This is well-regarded entry-level IT certification that focuses on technology fundamentals.  It is intended to prepare someone for roles such as help desk, IT support, PC repair, and junior systems administration.  The A+ certification focuses on 8 core competencies, which are referred to as domains, and is broken down into two examinations:
_Core 1_
1. Mobile Devices
2. Networking
3. Hardware
4. Virtualization and Cloud Computing
5. Hardware and Network Troubleshooting
_Core 2_
1. Operating Systems
2. Security
3. Software Troubleshooting
4. Operational Procedures
Both examinations must be passed in order to obtain the A+ certification.

## Benefits of Certification
- It provides a credential that confirms skill in a specific area
- It may help you obtain a job, get a promotion, or earn a raise
- Some automated resume scanning tools may pick up on certifications during the screening process, whereas you may be passed over without them
- It provides a roadmap for self-directed learning and job preparation
- It can be beneficial when entering a field with little to no IT work experience and/or a degree in computer science
- A certification may be prerequisite for certain tech positions
- A+ specific:  it is well-recognized in the IT field

## Drawbacks to Certification
- It takes time to study
- It will likely cost money to take the examination
- It does not guarantee that you will get a job, and the certification you chose may not be equally valued by all potential employers
- Strictly speaking, certificate does not prove proficiency - it only verifies that you can pass the test
- A+ specific:  it's specifically geared towards an entry-level job, which you could potentially obtain without the certification
- A+ specific:  it requires a significant amount of memorization, some of which pertains to old technologies that are not highly utilized today and/or things that could easily be looked up if needed

## Preparing for the A+ Exams
I am utilizing a variety of sources to prepare myself for the A+ examinations.  These include:
- [Google IT Support Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support?utm_source=google&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=gwgsite)
- [Professor Messer](https://www.professormesser.com/) - utilized free resources like videos and quizzes and paid options to include study guides and practice exams
- David L. Prowse's [Exam Cram  A+ book](https://www.pearson.com/store/p/comptia-a-practice-questions-exam-cram-core-1-220-1001-and-core-2-220-1002-/P100002534843/9780135566268)
- free online practice tests from [Exam Compass](https://www.examcompass.com/comptia/a-plus-certification/free-a-plus-practice-tests)
These study methods helped me pass the Core 1 exam last week, and I am well underway in my preparation to tackle Core 2.

## Is it worth it?
Obviously, the answer to that question will depend on what you hope to get out of the certification.  As IT is a new field for me, I have two main goals for pursuing certification.
### Building My Foundation
I am well-versed in the soft skills (customer service, oral and written communication, problem solving, etc.).  I also performed many support functions as elements of previous jobs and have a strong grasp on using technology in the workplace.  However, I have undoubtedly advanced my knowledge and understanding of IT fundamentals and concepts as I studied for these certifications.  They also provided me with a mechanism and incentive to get hands-on in a "lab" setting to simulate many of the core functions performed in IT support.  It has definitely been worth it for the learning experience I gained. 

### Obtaining a Job
The vast majority of tech jobs I have seen during the course of my job search have not referenced the Google IT Support certificate in the list of preferred or required qualifications.  I am unsure of the reason for this:  the certificate was only introduced in 2018 and may not have caught on yet, or it may just not be valued for whatever reason. Regardless, I decided to pursue the A+ to bolster my resume.  Time will tell whether having that additional credential will make a difference.

## A Final Note
I'm sure that these will just be the start of my certifications as I continue to learn and specialize in my IT career.  Feel free to let me know of your experiences and which certifications you have found to be most rewarding and beneficial to your career.
