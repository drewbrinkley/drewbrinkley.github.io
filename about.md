#### Hi, I'm Drew.

I spent the past 19 years working in the public sector at the state and local government levels.  A recent relocation from Arkansas to the Philadelphia area brought about an opportunity to reflect upon my career.  I am seeking to combine my strengths and interests from my prior positions with new skills learned through earning the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate to transition into a career in data analytics.

In all my positions, success meant communicating with customers and stakeholders to identify their issues and serve their needs within the framework of available resources.  Data was central to all aspects of my jobs, whether entering data into the organization's software to store or update records, querying the database to locate information, or creating reports to answer questions. 

I love solving problems.  Each new problem brings its own set of challenges, and I enjoy thinking critically and strategically to analyze the problem to identify solutions.  I also appreciate that each problem is unique and provides an opportunity to learn something new.  

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my wife, playing fetch with my dogs, going for a nice drive with the top down, and floating down a river on my kayak or paddleboard.  I also have a very strong beard game.

While you are here, please check out my resume and portfolio.  You can also see some of my recent projects below.
