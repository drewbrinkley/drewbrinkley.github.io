### Hi, I'm Drew.

#### My Background
I spent the 19 years working in the public sector at the state and local government levels.  A relocation from Arkansas to the Philadelphia area last year area brought about an opportunity to reflect upon my career.  I was looking for a new challenge, and the time seemed right to make a transition.

I love solving problems.  Each new problem brings its own set of challenges, and I enjoy thinking critically and strategically to analyze the problem and identify solutions.  I appreciate that each problem is unique and provides an opportunity to learn something new.  It was also important to me that whatever position I ended up in had a service component that allowed me to help others in some capacity.

My period of introspection led me to the Technology field.  I have always been interested in how technology can increase the efficiency and innovation with which people are able to work and connect.  Additionally, it seemed like a good fit for combining my strengths and interests from my prior positions.  Finally, the continuous learning required to keep abreast of technological changes means this career field will never leave me without a challenge.

#### A Meandering Path to Passion
In all my positions, success meant communicating with customers and stakeholders to identify their issues and serve their needs within the framework of available resources.  Data was central to all aspects of my jobs, whether entering data into the organization's software to store or update records, querying the database to locate information, or creating reports to answer questions. I came across the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and completed that with the intent to transition into a career in data analytics.  However, I decided that I would ultimately not be fulfilled by handing off my analysis to others who would actually make the decisions based upon my work. 

I got introduced to the R programming language through the data analytics curriculum, and I really enjoyed the brief introduction to programming.  I purchased a book on learning Python to continue that journey; however, I feared it would take me too long to become proficient enough at a language to land a developer job in a reasonable length of time.

I recalled that Google also had a IT Support certificate, and I completed that with the intent to obtain a Helpdesk position while I continued to learn and gain skills.  The program exposed me to components of Systems Administration and Security, and my ultimate goal is to take my new career path towards one of those areas of IT.

#### My Current Role
I am currently employed as a Consultant with IT Solutions Consulting.  I am an Analyst on our Cybersecurty Operations Center (CSOC) team, with a primary focus on providing data protection / DLP in the service of a large client.

#### Personal Interests
When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my wife, playing fetch with my dogs, going for a nice drive with the top down, and floating down a river on my kayak or paddleboard.  I also have a very strong beard game.

While you are here, please feel free check out my resume and portfolio.  You can also see some of my recent accomplishments below.
